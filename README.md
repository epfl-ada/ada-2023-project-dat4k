#  And if we were in a time loop ?


Research questions :
Is there a statistically significant recurrence of specific film genres during particular seasons or months of the year? 
Are there discernible patterns in the box office performance of specific film genres throughout the year, and do these patterns correlate with particular months?
Are the film released a specific season takes place in this same season?
Is there a relation between the connotation of the words and the season of release? For example, are there more positively connotated words in the plot of a movie in summer than in winter?
Do certain clusters of character types exhibit recurring trends in films released during specific months? 






As our study is based on a potential annual loop, having access to the release month date is crucial. To achieve this, we exclude every movie that does not contain this information. We have decided to remove all movies from years where there are fewer than 200 releases. Observing a significant increase in the number of movies from 1980 onwards, we have chosen to separate the dataframes into two sub-dataframes: one for years before 1980 and the other for years after 1980
