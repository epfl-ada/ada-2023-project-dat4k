#  And if we were in a time loop ?


## Abstract : 
What if we were stuck in a time loop? This is the question we try to answer throughout this study. We conduct a temporal analysis of movies‚Äô characteristics throughout the years and the months, focusing on the identification of patterns repeating over and over again in cinematographic history.  We aim to recognize a potential influence of the release date of a movie on its type, its plot and its success. To achieve this goal, we focus our interest on the main genres of the films, their recurring characters, the grossing profit they bring and their plot summaries. We hope that we‚Äôll manage to give you insights on the hidden mechanisms of the cinema industry!

## Research questions :

Is there a statistically significant recurrence of specific film genres during particular seasons or months of the year?
Are there discernible patterns in the box office performance of specific film genres throughout the year, and do these patterns correlate with particular months?
Is there a relation between the connotation of the words and the season of release? For example, are there more positively connotated words in the plot of a movie in summer than in winter?
Can we predict the season or month of release of a movie if we know all of its characteristics?

## Additional Dataset : 
[**Vocabularies**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-KcpE8cju60CcNXWc_gPZ6x3V8r7T5eH?usp=share_link):  We chose to add this dataset which is three lists of positive, negative and violent adjectives. We will use it to classify movies by a plot analysis thanks to different algorithms.


[**Budget**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?resource=download&select=movies_metadata.csv): We will use this dataset to verify if for two similar movies the difference of box office is due to the release date or to the investment accorded to it
